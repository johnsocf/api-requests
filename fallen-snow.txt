I hear the tigers call outside my doorstep.
Their quiet laughter comforts me.  
Like sleeping in stars
and wandering in clouds
and understanding mountains in snow.
In love with my life not my destruction.
indesctructable.
tired eyes and icy streets
slushy puddles not a problem for this girl
and her self-assured reliance.
not something to feel unacustomed to or misunderstand
as ownership
or heaven.
when it is not yours...
and the journey has not brough me to you.
no profound thought, words, or love
could dim that light and love that I see
ahead in the road that lies
like soft snow on the balance of life and wonder
in the balance of catching one's breath
like music for tiger's ears.
our thoughts on fallen snow.
